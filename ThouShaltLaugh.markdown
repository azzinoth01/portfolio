## My work

### Turn based battle system 

Implemented a clear turn-based framework managing player and enemy turns, including input handling, action resolution, and 
state transitions. The system ensures consistent pacing and smooth alternation between gameplay phases.

### Card system 

Created a modular card system defining each card’s type, effect, and feedback behavior. Cards trigger distinct 
visual and logical outcomes, allowing for straightforward extensibility and clean data-driven design.

### Sequencing

Built an event-driven sequencing system to coordinate card plays, animations, and enemy responses in the correct order. 
This ensures that visual effects, sound, and logic resolve seamlessly, providing polished timing and clear player 
feedback throughout the battle flow.
